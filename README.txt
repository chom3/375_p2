In order to use:
Have an input file ready.

Call the Makefile with make.

This will create a submission, bruteforce, and extracredit executable.

Submission will give the first part of the assignment, the divide and conquer 
recursive algorithm.

Bruteforce will give the brute force part of the assignment.

Extracredit will use 3 dimensions, for the extra credit.

An input file should have:

Index X Y 

Index can be any int, x and y can be any int.

An extra credit input file should have:

Index X Y Z

since you are using 3 dimensions.

How to use:
All the executables need an input file.txt and an output file.txt

./submission input.txt output.txt
./bruteforce input.txt output.txt
./extracredit input.txt output.txt

A sample input and inputExtra have been provided.
outputB, outputE, outputR are sample outputs for bruteforce, extracredit, and
the submission, respectively.
